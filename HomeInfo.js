                <p>
                    The purpose of this webapp is to present LeetCode patterns in a way that is minimalistic and simple.
                    This app is designed as a small flashcard-like studying app to help LeetCode learners memorize LeetCode
                    topics which they can then apply to LeetCode problems. The emphasis here is on the patterns instead of
                    the LeetCode problems themselves. Relevant LeetCode problems have been listed with each pattern for
                    those who wish to apply these patterns outside of this site.
